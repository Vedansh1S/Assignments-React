# Assignments

Collection of small React projects built with Vite and Tailwind CSS.

## Projects

- `Password-generator/` — Generate secure passwords with configurable length, character options, and one-click copy.
- `Paragraph-Generator/` — Create placeholder paragraphs with adjustable length and copy support.
- `OTP/` — Interactive OTP input component with auto-advance and smart paste handling.
- `ProfileComponent/` — Dashboard component with user profile, sidebar navigation, and webinar schedule display.

## Getting Started

```bash
cd Assignments/<project>
npm install
npm run dev
```

Each project runs on Vite’s dev server (defaults to `http://localhost:5173`). Stop any previous dev server before starting a new project to avoid port conflicts.
